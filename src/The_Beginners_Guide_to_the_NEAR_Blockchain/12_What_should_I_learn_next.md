## What should I learn next?

If you’ve gotten this far, you’re probably curious to learn more. There are a lot of resources out there but I’ll recommend a reasonable path through them. Blockchain is a highly technical field that covers just about every discipline under the sun so it can feel like drinking from a firehose without proper guidance.

If you’re pretty new to blockchain, start here to get a strong overview of the ecosystem and its development:

1. Deconstructing the blockchain ecosystem (2018, slides)

2. The state of blockchain product, design and development (2018)

After that, it’s a good idea to start diving a little deeper into the functional disciplines. The next layer deeper is to explore [the NEAR Protocol White Paper](https://near.org/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/), which is a human-readable deconstruction of every aspect of the project.  You can find it along with the other technical papers at:
