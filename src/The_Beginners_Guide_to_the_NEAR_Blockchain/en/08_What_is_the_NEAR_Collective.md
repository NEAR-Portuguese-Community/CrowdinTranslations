## What is the NEAR Collective?

**NEAR Collective** is the globally distributed group of teams, made up of many individual organizations and contributors, who self-organize in order to bring this technology to life.  It is not a business or anything nearly so formal. Think of it instead like the groups of people who run large open-source software projects.

One of the Collective’s projects is writing the initial code and the reference implementation for the open source NEAR network, sort of like building the rocket boosters on the space shuttle. Their job is to do the necessary R&D work to help the blockchain get into orbit. The [code for that chain is open source](https://github.com/near) so literally anyone can contribute to or run it.

It’s important to stress that networks like NEAR are designed to be totally decentralized. This means they ultimately operate completely on their own and can’t actually be censored, shut down or otherwise messed with by third parties… not even the teams who initially built them! So, while members of this collective are here to get the ball rolling on building the reference implementation, they quickly become nonessential to the operation of the network once it has started running.  In fact, once it’s launch-ready, anyone could modify and run the NEAR Protocol code to start up their own blockchain because it’s all open source and any changes would have to be democratically accepted by the independent validators who run it.

That said, the core teams can (and hopefully will) stick around to keep updating the system and performing bug fixes. After the network has been launched, any ongoing development work will hopefully be supported by the governance of the network through grant funding or other means.

One Collective member worth noting is [the NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/), a nonprofit entity whose entire goal is to build a vibrant and active long-term ecosystem around the blockchain and which has commissioned the development of the reference implementation of that chain.  The Foundation helps coordinate some of the early development work and governance activities.

The NEAR blockchain is only one of the NEAR Collective’s projects, so there are plenty of other areas where we can help the ecosystem going forward.
