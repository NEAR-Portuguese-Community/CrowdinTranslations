## The Basics

So what is NEAR (aka “the NEAR Platform”)? NEAR is a decentralized development platform built on top of the NEAR Protocol, which is a public, sharded, developer-friendly, proof-of-stake blockchain. Put another way, NEAR is like a public community-run cloud platform.  That means it is a highly scalable, low cost platform for developers to create decentralized apps on top of. While it’s built on top of the NEAR Protocol blockchain, the NEAR Platform also contains a wide range of tooling from explorers to CLI tools to wallet apps to interoperability components which help developers build much more easily and the ecosystem to scale more widely.

Whereas most other “scalable” blockchains use approaches that centralize processing on high-end hardware to provide a temporary boost in throughput, NEAR Protocol’s approach allows the platform’s capacity to scale nearly linearly up to billions of transactions in a fully decentralized way.

NEAR is being built by the NEAR Collective, a global collection of people and organizations who are collaboratively building this massive open source project. Everyone in this Collective is fanatically focused on enabling usability improvements for both developers and their end-users so the next wave of apps can cross the chasm to a more general audience that has thus far been unable to consistently work with blockchain-based apps built on today’s platforms.

This Collective contains a number of extraordinary teams and [includes championship-level competitive programmers](https://near.org/team) who have built some of the only at-scale sharded database systems in the world. In a space dominated by academic research projects and failures to launch, NEAR has a team well accustomed to shipping. It is also backed by financial and community contributions by [the best names in the crypto industry](https://near.org/backers).

Why are we doing this? Because this is an opportunity to build the ground floor for a far better Internet which puts the user in control of their money, their data and their identity. With the potential for creating composable open-state services, it’s a chance to kick start the biggest wave of innovation — and business progress — since the Internet.  This vision is the biggest sort — there are few opportunities in the world larger than the one we are tackling.

Let’s be clear: **NEAR is not a side chain, an ERC20 token or a highly specialized task-specific blockchain… it is nothing less than a brand new and fundamentally reimagined layer 1 protocol designed to independently power the base of the emerging Open Web stack.**

Ok… Let’s back up and assume you’re still getting up to speed on what the heck a public, sharded, developer-friendly, proof-of-stake blockchain really is.

#### From 10,000 feet…

The NEAR Collective is basically building the infrastructure for a new Internet which makes it harder for giant companies to steal your data and for bad guy countries to shut it down. People have been trying to figure this stuff out with similar technologies since 2008 but it’s been slow going.

You’ve heard of Bitcoin, that digital currency everyone thinks is only used by criminals and third-world dictators. Well, despite a really bad reputation and a lot of hiccups along the way, ten years later they still haven’t been able to kill Bitcoin so you know it’s built on very resilient technology. We’re basically trying to use that same kind of technology to power a brand new Internet which is just as hard to kill or screw up.

A few other projects, especially one called Ethereum, tried doing this a few years ago and got a really good start but ultimately got totally bogged down in the growing pains of early technology and they were too slow and expensive to get mainstream adoption. Now, a lot of really smart people are working on a way to speed this up and keep costs low while making sure this new Internet is just as hard to mess up as Bitcoin.

#### From 1,000 feet…

We aren’t building the only blockchain which is taking on the scaling and cost problems but NEAR has a team that’s all aces and we’re coming at this in a slightly different way.

To set the stage, we’re building a “base-layer blockchain”, meaning that it’s on the same level of the infrastructure as projects like Ethereum, EOS or Polkadot. That means everything else will be built on top of NEAR.

It’s a general-purpose platform that allows developers to create and deploy decentralized applications on top of it. A decent analogy is that it’s sort of like Amazon’s AWS platform, which is where most of the applications you know and love host their servers, except the NEAR platform isn’t actually run and controlled by one company, it’s run and controlled by thousands or even millions of people. You can call it a “community-operated cloud” but we usually prefer to simply call it a “decentralized application platform.”
