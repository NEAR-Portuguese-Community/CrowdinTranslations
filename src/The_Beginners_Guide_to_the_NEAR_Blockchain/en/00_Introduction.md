# The Beginner’s Guide to the NEAR Blockchain

Welcome! This guide is intended to help anyone interested in understanding what NEAR actually is. That includes new users, curious community members, prospective partners and new core contributors to the NEAR Collective. I’ll provide a plain-English understanding of what we do, why we do it, and how you can learn what you need in order to get directly involved.

We’ll keep this guide updated over time as well so you can be sure it’s as current as possible.

My assumption is that you’re familiar with the high level of what a blockchain is so I’m not going to be using any of those block-and-line diagrams here. I’ll make no assumption about your level of technicality — you could be a highly technical engineer but you could be a less technical designer or marketer or community manager as well.
