## Qual é o caminho à frente?

In the early phases of this market, projects focused on strutting a bunch of vanity metrics in order to get as many retail investors on board for a big ICO (initial coin offering). That meant trying to have the biggest Telegram community, the most big-name advisors, the best-looking proof-of-concept projects from big businesses and so on.

The ICO boom finished in 2018 so, luckily, we’re able to focus more on what actually matters. In this case, it’s all about community and adoption.

We have extraordinary technical teams who are working to make sure the technology is implemented properly but everything they build will be open source. That means anyone in the world could, theoretically, just copy the code and run their own NEAR blockchain. Now, it’s not quite as easy as that and our teams’ expertise puts this version ahead should anyone try that, but ultimately technology is merely a time-based advantage. The real traction comes from building a great community.

The ecosystem is most useful when there are lots of applications and lots of users who want to use those applications. Because we see a world where the major development paradigm is to build in a decentralized fashion, there is lots of ground to cover between here and there. So the key metric we’re shooting for is adoption and usage of the platform.

A lot of projects are focusing on targeting developers to build apps on top of their platforms. That’s obviously important since this is a highly technical field but it’s not the only thing that matters. Specifically, if you look at the history of major development platforms, the ones that are truly successful need to support real, at-scale businesses not just a bunch of side projects.

So building an ecosystem that has the kind of functional breadth and technical depth to create at-scale businesses for the long term is everything to us. That requires significant efforts on the dimensions of community building, education and overall user experience. And plenty of cool technical tools as well, of course!

Luckily, if we succeed, we have the opportunity to drive the greatest wealth creation since the original Internet by helping developers and entrepreneurs everywhere access new markets and build new kinds of businesses on top of the NEAR Protocol. The upside of what we’re doing is super exciting!
