## Qual é o caminho à frente?

Nas fases iniciais deste mercado, projetos focados em solucionar um monte de métricas de vaidade a fim de obter o máximo de investidores de varejo a bordo para uma grande ICO (oferta inicial de moeda). Isso significou tentar ter a maior comunidade do Telegram, os consultores de maior nome, os projetos de provas de conceito mais bonitos de grandes empresas e assim por diante.

A explosão de ICO terminou em 2018 então, felizmente, somos capazes de focar mais no que realmente importa. No caso, trata-se de comunidade e adoção.

Temos equipes técnicas extraordinárias que estão trabalhando para garantir que a tecnologia seja implementada adequadamente, mas tudo o que eles construírem será de código aberto. That means anyone in the world could, theoretically, just copy the code and run their own NEAR blockchain. Now, it’s not quite as easy as that and our teams’ expertise puts this version ahead should anyone try that, but ultimately technology is merely a time-based advantage. The real traction comes from building a great community.

The ecosystem is most useful when there are lots of applications and lots of users who want to use those applications. Because we see a world where the major development paradigm is to build in a decentralized fashion, there is lots of ground to cover between here and there. So the key metric we’re shooting for is adoption and usage of the platform.

A lot of projects are focusing on targeting developers to build apps on top of their platforms. That’s obviously important since this is a highly technical field but it’s not the only thing that matters. Specifically, if you look at the history of major development platforms, the ones that are truly successful need to support real, at-scale businesses not just a bunch of side projects.

So building an ecosystem that has the kind of functional breadth and technical depth to create at-scale businesses for the long term is everything to us. That requires significant efforts on the dimensions of community building, education and overall user experience. And plenty of cool technical tools as well, of course!

Luckily, if we succeed, we have the opportunity to drive the greatest wealth creation since the original Internet by helping developers and entrepreneurs everywhere access new markets and build new kinds of businesses on top of the NEAR Protocol. The upside of what we’re doing is super exciting!
