## Recursos Gerais

#### Podcasts

Os podcasts são uma das melhores maneiras de se informar porque os catálogos anteriores podem ser muito informativos. Eu recomendo praticar um esporte de longa duração, onde você pode ouvi-los por horas a fio e, em seguida, consumir o seguinte:

1. **[Laura Shin’s Unchained](http://unchainedpodcast.co/)** and **[Unconfirmed](https://unconfirmed.libsyn.com/)** for plain-English interviews
2. **[Epicenter](https://epicenter.tv/)** for a bit more technical dives into various systems.
3. **[Zero Knowledge](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/)** is another on the more technical side.

#### Newsletters

There aren’t too many great newsletters and you should avoid anything that is primarily price or trading focused. Dito isso, confira:

1. **[Token Economy](http://weekly.tokeneconomy.co/)** is a good weekly roundup.
2. It’s highly Bitcoin-biased but I do enjoy reading Anthony Pompliano’s **[Off the Chain daily](https://offthechain.substack.com/)** because it doesn’t have a lot of BS.
3. The **[CB Insights newsletter](https://www.cbinsights.com/newsletter)** is more broad-ranging but generally has one general-interest blockchain story per issue.

#### Writing

1. The team from **a16z Crypto** has excellent writing on everything from legal issues around tokens to the future of web 3 with open state. See their main blog at https://a16zcrypto.com/content but also check out the original a16z blog before 2018 when they migrated to the new site for the legacy content, which is great too.
2. **Vitalik** from the Ethereum Foundation has been a prolific writer over the years and just about everything he puts out is interesting. Check out his blog at https://vitalik.ca/ and Ethereum-related research at https://ethresear.ch/.
