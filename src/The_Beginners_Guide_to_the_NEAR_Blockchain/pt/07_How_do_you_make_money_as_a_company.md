## Como você ganha dinheiro como uma "empresa"?

Boa pergunta. Para começar, **NEAR não é uma empresa!**

One of the biggest stumbling blocks people seem to have with blockchains is figuring out how they work as if they were traditional businesses. And that’s totally valid since the 2017 bubble saw all manner of convoluted monetization schemes which actually didn’t make any sense and usually didn’t require a token anyway.

The key to understanding this is realizing that the entire economics supporting the NEAR network are embedded at the protocol level and allow anyone to participate in the protocol by running a validating node themselves. Users of the network pay costs to use this network and the providers of the network capacity receive rewards from this activity.  There is no shadowy company behind it all which is secretly trying to sell subscriptions or anything like that. The protocol has self-sustaining economics.

The people who build the early technology are rewarded with participation in the initial allocation of tokens and funded by fiat contributions from early financial backers.
