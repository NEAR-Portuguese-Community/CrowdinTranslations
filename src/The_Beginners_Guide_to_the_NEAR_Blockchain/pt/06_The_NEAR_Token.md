## O Token NEAR

So who actually runs all those individual “nodes” that make up this decentralized network? Anyone who feels properly incentivized to do so! The [incentives for this permissionless network](https://near.org/blog/near-protocol-economics/) are powered by the NEAR token.

The NEAR token is how people who use applications on the network pay to submit transactions to the nodes who actually run the network. The token is thus a utility — if you hold it, you can use applications hosted on the network.

This is a little different from today’s web, where applications are owned by single developers or corporations who pay their cloud hosting bills on behalf of their users. Some aspects of the NEAR protocol allow developers to do this as well but, for simplicity, we will assume users generally pay directly for their use of the network.

Because NEAR is a permissionless protocol, anyone can run one of the nodes which operate the network by validating transactions which have been submitted to the network. But running infrastructure, even simple code that you can run from a laptop, costs some money and time, so few people would do it for free. Thus, in exchange for performing that service, you earn a portion of the transaction fees paid by users during each block where you are validating transactions.

How does the network make sure you’re actually running the code you’re supposed to and not just freeloading and earning income? You are required to “stake” your tokens (which basically means putting them in escrow) as a gesture of good faith. If you perform any malicious behavior (like trying to hack the system or mess with other people’s transactions), you will lose your stake. The system figures this out by coming to “consensus” among the nodes in each period and determining how the code should have been run so it’s easy to identify who did so improperly.

Luckily, you really don’t have to think about this stuff because, as long as you download and start up the standard node program from a reputable source, it all happens behind the scenes by the application code you downloaded and so you aren’t likely to lose your stake.
