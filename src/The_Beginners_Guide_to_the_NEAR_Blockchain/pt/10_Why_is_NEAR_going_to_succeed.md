## Porque a NEAR vai ter sucesso?

You can take this from two perspectives — what makes the NEAR Protocol likely to actually get to market and what makes it better to developers/end-users once we get it there? Let’s explore both.

#### Execution Matters

What says the NEAR team is going to out-execute the competition and get into the market with the right technology on the right timeline?

For starters… [NEAR has already launched its MainNet genesis](https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-genesis/)!  And it [handed off operation to the community](https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-is-now-community-operated/) as planned :). But also…

If you hop over to the NEAR project website and [you’ll see the best team in the industry](https://www.near.org/team) and, importantly, a team who has shipped sharded systems before in production settings. Having that kind of experienced team behind it already sets the NEAR Protocol apart from almost every other network out there.

Essa tecnologia é complicada! Technically speaking, sharding is a scaling approach that’s being seriously attempted by roughly a dozen chains, including the market-leading Ethereum… but they’ve taken years to put together their proposal and expect to take more years to implement it. So it’s non-trivial to get this started.

To round things out, the NEAR team has the support of [the best financial and non-financial backers](https://www.near.org/backers) in the space and a cadre of informal advisors who span everything from economics and mechanism design to cryptography and blockchain design.

#### Killer Features for Everyone

This market — and the technology — is still in the “roll up your sleeves, it’s going to be messy” phase. Every major stakeholder group has challenges:

1. **For developers**, that means the tools are really hard to use and hundreds of teams are building hundreds of different things that point in all different directions, including some projects inventing their own programming languages. In short, it’s chaos and it’s painful to develop on existing systems.

2. **For end users**, the path to getting started with crypto projects and the new web is incredibly long. In the normal web world, you lose a huge portion of users for each step you make them go through before achieving their goal. Right now, to get a brand new user from zero to playing a crypto-based game or sending a friend money, it takes literally *dozens* of steps… and it’s incredibly slow and somewhat expensive to perform these steps. Not ideal.

3. **For Validators**, the people who run the nodes which actually operate the network, their options for receiving tokens from their communities are very limited by existing protocol designs so they are forced to compete with each other based entirely on price, which commoditizes their offerings and makes them less attractive to prospective delegators who might lend them tokens.

All of these problems require a fanatical focus on user experience and user needs as the driving force for creating technology instead of starting by driving technology forward and then seeing what happens. We’ve been developing the NEAR Protocol and many supporting tools with a focus on these experiences while stepping forward to engage the broader community on solving these issues. It’s not going to be fast or easy, but it is the priority for us.

We describe the NEAR platform as “developer-friendly” or “usable” because it implements approaches at the protocol level which address each of those problems:

1. **For developers**, NEAR’s contract-based account model allows them to build advanced permissions into their apps and sign transactions on behalf of users.  They also have access to a set of tools that make app composition straightforward and the opportunity for a protocol-level fee rebate which compensates them for creating well-used apps and critical system infrastructure.

2. **For end users**, the flexible account model allows them to benefit from “progressive UX”, which means they don’t have to touch wallets or tokens until they are ready because the application is hiding them behind the scenes.  For their end-users, the way our accounts are set up allows for smoother onboarding experiences which don’t require as many steps or as many annoying wallet pop-ups.

3. **For validators**, having access to “delegation” at the contract level means that they can create infinitely diversified offerings of their services, thus making NEAR a very attractive place to run validating nodes.
