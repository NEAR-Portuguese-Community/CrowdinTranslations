# Step 4 – Testing web3

## O objetivo de hoje é escrever testes que passem para os seus contratos.

## Principais atividades

In the Resources section below choose AssemblyScript or Rust

* WRITE 3-5 unit tests for each contract listed as CORE Activity

# Recursos

REMEMBER:

* You DO need to build (and run tests, if available) for each contract
* You should TRY to understand EVERY line of code in the contract

## AssemblyScript

For a minimum of 3 contracts marked as CORE Activity in the Step 2 list

1. Write 3-5 new unit tests for each contract whether or not it already has unit tests
2. Verify the tests pass as expected (tests can be run via command line)

## Rust

For a minimum of 3 contracts marked as CORE Activity in the Step 2 list

1. Write 3-5 new unit tests for each contract whether or not it already has unit tests
2. Verify the tests pass as expected (tests can be run via IDE or command line)

Unit testing is included as part of the Rust language.

All of NEAR’s [Core Contracts](https://github.com/near/core-contracts) include unit tests if you want to see some good examples.
