# Step 3 – Writing web3

## The goal for today is to write contracts that compile.

Make sure you clone every repository and build it locally. Getting each application running is as important as reading the code because today you will be focused on understanding how all the moving parts work.

If you get stuck on one application for some reason, just ask for help in Discord and MOVE ON immediately. If possible, don’t wait for someone to reply before you continue or you will lose time.

## CORE Activities

In the Resources section below choose AssemblyScript or Rust

* REVIEW all 3 applications labeled as CORE Activity for your language

If you prefer to have specific steps, you could do something like this to study each contract or dApp carefully:

1. Pick any contract from Step 2 or dApp from Step 3 (see below)
2. Clone the repo locally (or in Gitpod if using Windows)
3. Make sure you can find the contract source code and that you can compile the contract to a .wasm file
4. Test the contract somehow so you know it’s working. You can do this using NEAR CLI commands or by running existing unit or simulation tests, or even by using a web interface if the dApp has one. The KEY idea here is to make sure you will NOTICE a change to the contract if you make one
5. Make any small change to the contract. Not a big change, but something simple.
6. Rebuild and retest (repeat steps 3 & 4)
7. Did the change you made work as expected? Or did you break something?
8. Ask for help if you need it
9. Keep repeating 6-7-8 until your confidence increases… until you believe you understand the contract and can control it
10. Delete the contract and write it again from your notes (you took notes right?). You can also just rewrite small parts of the contract, of course.

# Resources

## Remember for today’s activity

* You DO need to build (and run tests, if available for) each dApp (“decentralized app”)
* You should TRY to understand EVERY line of code in the contract

| Simple Counter without SDK         | This example shows how to make a simple NEAR AssemblyScript contract. Normally the SDK does a lot behind the scenes. When calling a function with arguments it deserializes it for you, so in this example each exposed function has no arguments. Furthermore, if a function returns a value the SDK will serialize it for you too, so again these functions do not return anything.  Unfortunately current the serialization must be imported, which adds bloat to the generated binary. In this example we only use the host imports and the generated optimized binary is only 309 bytes!  The advantage to using AssemblyScript is that you can write code that generates Wasm text that is readable and close to the code that you wrote. This makes AssemblyScript a great language to learn about WebAssembly! | https://github.com/near-examples/simple_counter_as                          |

"Token Printer" is the friendly dApp name but technically this is a faucet with the additional feature of making the user complete some proof of work to take time between requests for tokens.  also note that "proof of work" here is NOT related to network consensus and proof of stake for NEAR or proof of work for Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 ... "proof of work" is a general term for any algorithm that consumes verifiable time and cannot be tricked to work faster)  This example consists of 2 parts:  - Transfer Faucet contract that allows to transfer tokens to a desired account for doing required Proof of Work - Faucet frontend that allows to enter the account ID to receive transfer | https://github.com/near-examples/token-printer      |
