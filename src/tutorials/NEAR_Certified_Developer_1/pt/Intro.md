# Desenvolvedor Certificado NEAR
Este curso é uma oportunidade para os desenvolvedores web ganharem um certificado de conclusão que representa a capacidade de projetar, desenvolver, testar e implantar contratos inteligentes na plataforma NEAR.

# Bem-vindo
Que bom que você pôde se juntar a nós. Vamos trabalhar juntos para aprender a construir aplicativos descentralizados na plataforma de contrato inteligente conhecida como NEAR Protocol.

Aqui está um relatório sobre o que estava acontecendo no setor com as chamadas plataformas de "camada 1" em dezembro de 2020. A pesquisa deixa bem claro: NEAR chegou.

# Before Step 1
Please make sure you are familiar with a few of these basics before the week starts. Although you do not need to be an expert in these technologies, you should have no problem cloning a NodeJS project, downloading its dependencies and running a few scripts.

* Basic JavaScript client and serverside development (see here and here)
* Basic terminal control (see here and here )
* Basic git commands (see here and here).

# Overview

During this course we will practice:

* perceiving web 3 in the context of human history

The course will include lots of listening, watching, reading and writing.

# FAQ
## 1. How much does this cost?
Nothing, in fact we pay you to complete this course.

## 2. Do I need to be a software developer to take this course?
No, you do not, but it won’t be easy and you should budget 10 hours per day, no joke.

If you are a junior software developer who recently graduated from a bootcamp or has less than 3 years professional experience, you should budget 4-6 hours per day. If you are an senior software developer with 5 years of professional experience or more, you should budget about 2-4 hours per day. If you are an experienced blockchain developer then you will likely be able to keep up with this course with about 1 hour per day of work.

## 3. Do I need a Mac?
MacOS and Linux will be the easiest operating systems to use.

Windows may prove challenging but if you’re ok with that, please join us.

## 4. How do I know if I’m winning?
There’s no such thing as winning here because we’re all lost. Welcome, friend.

## 5. When moon?!
Please don’t.

## 6. Do you care if I cheat?
No, in fact cheating is encouraged. Let’s get one thing straight: if you’re serious about learning, the fastest way from here to there is to meet people, ask questions, look at some answers, look at even more answers, copy some examples, break things and finally, if you’re lucky, learn something new.

As long as you’re honest about what you’re doing, you’re always welcome here.

Just don’t take credit for others people’s work because that’s lame.
