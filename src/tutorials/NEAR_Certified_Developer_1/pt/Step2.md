# Etapa 2 - Leitura da web3

## O objetivo para hoje é ler o maior número possível de contratos.

Tente descobrir como chegar ao código do contrato. Then move to quickly read the code. You want to see as much as you can. Ask yourself about the “purpose” of the contract (why is it?) and “code” (what is it?)

* AssemblyScript contracts are files that end in .ts, usually main.ts or index.ts
* Rust contracts are always in a file named lib.rs.

## CORE Activities

Choose AssemblyScript or Rust and REVIEW all 3 contracts labeled as CORE Activity for your language


## BONUS Activities

Clone the [starter repository](https://github.com/Learn-NEAR/starter--AssemblyScript) for AssemblyScript and follow the instructions.

# Resources

## Remember for today’s activity

* You do NOT need to build and test each contract
* You do NOT need to understand every line of code
* You SHOULD simply read through the contracts as if you are looking at art or listening to music without worring about every dot or note
