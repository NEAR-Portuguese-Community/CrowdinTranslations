## Design

We’re focusing on building a great developer and end-user experience. And here are a few resources that will be helpful from a design perspective.

1. Improving blockchain developer experience (slides)
2. The design of blockchain-based applications (DApps) (slides)
3. Why the future will be driven by “UX Equilibrium”
4. Check out the San Francisco Blockchain Product, Design and 5. Development meetup group to get a sense of the kind of broader community we’re hoping to build across functional disciplines
5. Bonus: Look for YouTube talks from the folks at Consensys, Coinbase and IDEO Colab.
