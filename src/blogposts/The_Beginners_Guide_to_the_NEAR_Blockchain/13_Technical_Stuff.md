## Technical Stuff
No matter what role you have, you’ll need to get up to speed technically because the lingo is going to come up repeatedly. That doesn’t necessarily mean you have to understand all the computer science underneath it but you should know the basics.

Generally:

1. What are decentralized applications and how do they work (slides)
2. Using blockchain in “regular” web and mobile apps (slides)
3. An overview of “all you need to know” in blockchain development by Haseeb Qureshi

NEAR specific:
1. **Overview:**
    1. Check out [the NEAR Whitepaper](https://near.org/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/) for the first layer of depth into the technical aspects of this project.
    2. From there, this blog (at https://near.org/blog) is the best record of technical specs as they grow and change over time. Subscribe for updates at https://near.org/newsletter.
    3. A good primer is on the [Bison Trails blog](https://bisontrails.co/near-on-the-bison-trails-platform/).

2. **Economics:**
    1. Learn about how NEAR Economics work in the [Introduction to NEAR Economics post](https://near.org/blog/near-protocol-economics/)
    2. Dive deeper [into the NEAR Economics Paper](https://near.org/papers/economics-in-sharded-blockchain/)
    3. If you are curious about acquiring tokens in the future, any information about that will be available on [the tokens page](https://near.org/tokens).

3. **Technical:**
    1. The [NEAR Whiteboard Series on YouTube](https://near.ai/whiteboard_series) has founders Alex and Illia do technical deep-dives with the founders of over 30 other projects including Ethereum, Cosmos, Nervos, Celo, IOTA, and so on.
    2. Differences between the NEAR approach and Ethereum 2.0 sharding (written with Vitalik’s feedback)
    3. Our sharding talk at Blockchain@Berkeley
    4. Our work with Vlad Zamfir on a sharding POC during the Ethereum SF hackathon
